# WI-FI-Password-Identifier.
The Wi-Fi Password Identifier project aims to develop a tool or application that retrieves and displays saved Wi-Fi passwords on a device. When users forget their Wi-Fi passwords, this tool can help them recover it by accessing the locally stored credentials of previously connected networks.
